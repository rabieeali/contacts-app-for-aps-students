# contacts-app-for-aps-students
crud with vanilla js, react redux, express

 I'm going to build 3 levels of contact list app
 
 First) vanilla javascript! I used json-server for my backend, tailwindcss, daisyUI, and just to keep everything at foundational level I used javascript fetch
 
 Second) a RESTfull API with node.js and express.js and MongoDB
 
 Third) a React Redux App using react-redux and redux-thunk, material UI
