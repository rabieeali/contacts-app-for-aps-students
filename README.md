# CRUD with Vanilla JS, React Redux, and Express

I'm going to build a contact list app with three levels of complexity using different technologies.

## Level 1: Vanilla JavaScript
For the first level, I'll be using vanilla JavaScript. I'll use JSON-server as the backend, along with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling. To handle API requests, I'll utilize JavaScript's fetch API.

## Level 2: RESTful API with Node.js and Express.js
At the second level, I'll create a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js, along with MongoDB as the database. This will allow for more advanced functionality and database operations.

## Level 3: React Redux App with Material UI
For the final level, I'll build a React Redux app using react-redux and redux-thunk for state management. To enhance the UI, I'll incorporate Material UI components for a more polished and professional look.

This project aims to provide a real-world foundational application, primarily focused on building an admin dashboard. It's being developed with great dedication for APS students.

Let's get started!
